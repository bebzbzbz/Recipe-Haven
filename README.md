# Recipe Haven ü•óüçπ

The Pok√©mon API Project was developed as a team and offers an interactive application that makes it possible to retrieve Pok√©mon data from a public API. The main features include displaying an overview of all Pok√©mon per generation on the home page, the ability to search for a specific Pok√©mon, and a detailed view of each Pok√©mon that includes additional information such as types and attacks.

The application was developed using React.js and implements a user-friendly navigation that allows users to switch between different views and Pok√©mon detail pages. The header includes a dark/light mode button to customise the user interface according to the user's preferences.

The design was developed with a mobile-first approach and implemented using TailwindCSS to ensure that the application works optimally on mobile devices. At the same time, the project was designed to be fully responsive so that it adapts to different screen sizes and provides a user-friendly interface on all devices.
