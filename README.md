# Recipe Haven 🥗🍹

The Pokémon API Project was developed as a team and offers an interactive application that makes it possible to retrieve Pokémon data from a public API. The main features include displaying an overview of all Pokémon per generation on the home page, the ability to search for a specific Pokémon, and a detailed view of each Pokémon that includes additional information such as types and attacks.

The application was developed using React.js and implements a user-friendly navigation that allows users to switch between different views and Pokémon detail pages. The header includes a dark/light mode button to customise the user interface according to the user's preferences.

## Design

The design of the project is based on a Figma template, which serves as the basis for the layout and colour palette to ensure a consistent and appealing user interface. The design was developed with a mobile-first approach and implemented using TailwindCSS to ensure that the application works optimally on mobile devices. At the same time, the project was designed to be fully responsive so that it adapts to different screen sizes and provides a user-friendly interface on all devices.
